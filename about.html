    <p id="about-description">Things left behind, in other words ‚ÄúGidenlerden Kalanlar‚Äù was a popular blog in Turkey during the mid-2000s. 
        The site was centered around a woman who decided to give away her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs belongings after a breakup. 
        She wrote short, emotional posts about each item she was giving away, and these posts often reflected themes of separation, longing, and the process of moving on.
        Though the site is no longer active, its influence can still be seen in social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where similar anonymous emotional posts are shared. 
        For those who experienced it, the site remains a nostalgic part of their past.

            <h3 class="about-questions">What tools or technologies were used in building the website?</h3>
            <p class="about-answers">Nida used a combination of HTML, CSS, and especially Flexbox to build the structure and layout of the website. Before diving into coding, she designed the wireframe and mockup in Figma to thoughtfully plan the visual flow. Using both design and development tools allowed her to see the full process through‚Äîfrom concept to code‚Äîwith care and creativity.</p>
